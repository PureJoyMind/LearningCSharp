# WorkflowEngine
This parrt of my practice. 

# Task
Design a workflow engine that takes a workflow object and runs it. A workflow is a series of steps
or activities. The workflow engine class should have one method called Run() that takes a
workflow, and then iterates over each activity in the workflow and runs it.
We want our workflows to be extensible, so we can create new activities without impacting the
existing activities.
